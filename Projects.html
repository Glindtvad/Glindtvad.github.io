Greenland shark (<i>Somniosus microcephalus</i>) catches in fisheries conducted in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Regulatory Area (ongoing)
</p>
<p style="line-height:2; padding-top: 1">
While an intern at NAFO in 2018, I helped with various projects and preparations. One such project was a spatio-temporal analysis of greenland shark bycatches in the NAFO regulated fishing areas. I did this study with Lisa Hendrickson from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US. The resulting analysis was published as a Scientific Counncil Research document, and was presented at the NAFO annual Scientific Council meeting. The study is still being conducted with increased spatial quality. The full SCR document can be found <a href="https://www.nafo.int/Portals/0/PDFs/sc/2018/scr18-020REV2.pdf">here</a>.

<div class="panel">
<p style="line-height:2; font-size: 18 px">
The Greenland shark (<i>Somniosus microcephalus</i>), a large, benthopelagic shark, has been listed as “Near Threatened” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List since 2006. The IUCN-recommended conservation actions includedocumentation of catches in North Atlantic and Arctic fisheries and determination of fisheries-related population declines. This report isa response, in part, to a request from the Fisheries Commission ofthe Northwest Atlantic FisheriesOrganization (NAFO)to the Scientific Council fordocumentation ofGreenland shark catchesin NAFO fisheries and summarization ofexisting data useful for assessingthe status of the population inhabiting NAFO waters.We found thatnominal catches of Greenland sharkhave beenreported to NAFO since2002, but reporting was inconsistent.Catchesrangedfrom1 tin 2002 and 2004 to71 tin2017; 69% of the catches during 2002-2017 werefrom Subarea 1.NAFO Observer Programdata indicatedthatbycatch of Greenland shark in the NAFO Regulatory Area increased rapidlybetween 2014 and 2017, from 34t to 281t and from at least75 to 180 individuals, respectively.Most of the bycatchduring 2014-2017,89% of the weightand 67% of thenumbers, occurred in bottom trawls andthe remainder occurred onlonglines.Total bycatch numbers(representing minimums)werehighest (43%) in the Greenland halibut bottom trawl fishery, mainly in Division 3L, followed by the Atlantic halibut longline fishery (26%), mainly in Division 3N,and the redfish bottom trawl fishery (19%), mainly in Divisions 3Mand 3N. Bycatch weight was also highest in the Greenland halibut bottom trawl fishery (52%),followed by the redfish bottom trawl fishery (27%), andthe Atlantic halibut longline fishery (8%).The inconsistent reporting of nominal catches of Greenland sharks should be remediedand we also suggestimprovements to the collection of Greenland shark bycatch data by NAFO observers.These recommendations will improve our knowledge about the Greenland shark population inhabitingthe Northwest Atlantic Ocean and many of the recommendationscan be implemented now.

Morphometric Analysis of Cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>) Otoliths (finished)

<p style="line-height:2; padding-top: 1">
My master’s thesis was a joint project between the Institute for Natural Resources in Greenland and the University of Aarhus. My thesis was a study on the use of otolith shape discrimination of different Atlantic cod stocks in Greenland waters. The thesis consists of areview of Atlantic cod stocks, otolith research and the theory behind statistical shape analysis, ending with an article manuscript of my study.

<div class="panel">
<p style="line-height:2; font-size: 18px">
Four genetically different populations of cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>) inhabit the waters along the coast of Greenland. These populations share habitats on the west coast, and current available fishery management tools for population separation are restricted to Genetic classification. As genetic classification is both time consuming and expensive, alternative classification methods are need. In this study, the use of otolith outline shape analysis as a tool for population separation was investigated. Both Discrete Wavelet Transform and Normalized Elliptic Fourier were used. The whole outline of the otolith, as well as the outline of the 1st and 2nd year increments were used for shape analysis. Normalized Elliptic Fourier showed more potential than the Discrete Wavelet Transform for populations classification. Two out of the three populations could be classified with a high mean classification rate (&gt;70%). The 1st and 2nd year increments provided a lower mean classification success (&lt;65%) than the whole shape of the otolith. Neither genetics nor environment were found to have a significant influence on the whole otolith shape. Age group separated shape analysis indicated a possible migration from inshore areas to offshore areas by the West Greenland Offshore cod population. Further studies should be done to investigate a combination of shape analysis and other population classification methods for fishery management purposes.

Australian Weaver ants on different diets (finished)

<p style="line-height:2; padding-top: 1">
My bachelor project was a study in behavioral biology on the effect of high protein and sugar diets on the activity and mortality of worker ants from the species Australian Weaver ants.

<div class="panel">
<p style="line-height:2; font-size: 18px">
The objective of this project was to examine the effects of a high protein and a high sugar diet on the rate of consumption, foraging activity, and mortality of the Australian Weaver Ant (<i>Oecophylla smaragdina</i>). Each small colony of ants were fed with one of three specific diets, a Bhatkar diet for control, a high-protein or a high-sugar derivative. On the basis of the collected data: consumption, activity and mortality for each colony were calculated in order to ascertain the effect of each diet, on the workers behavior and mortality ratio. The result of these calculations showed a significant increase in the mortality ratio for workers fed with the high-protein diet as opposed to mortality ratio of the other diets. The ant workers feeding on high-protein diet also proved to have a significant increase in rate of consumption, when compared to the workers fed with the high-sugar diet. Additionally workers fed with the high-sugar diet, displayed a significant increase in activity, when compared to workers on the high-protein diet or the standard Bhatkar diet.
